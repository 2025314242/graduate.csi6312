Using the table, write the Python code that extracts relevant data to answer the question.

Return exactly one valid JSON object with the following structure:

{{
    "description": "<brief natural language explanation of what subset you are extracting>",
    "python_code": "def extract_relevant_data(df: pd.DataFrame) -> pd.DataFrame:\n\t# your pandas code here\n\treturn relevant_data"
}}

Requirements for `python_code`:
- The function name must be `extract_relevant_data`.
- Assume the input DataFrame is called `df`.
- Use only pandas operations.
- Assign the extracted subset to `relevant_data`.
- End with `return relevant_data`.
- Do NOT include import statements, print statements, or comments outside the function.
- The string must contain valid, runnable code.
