Using the table, write the Vega-Lite v5 chart specification that help answer the question.

Return exactly one valid JSON object with the following structure:

{{
    "description": "<one concise sentence of alternative text>",
    "vega_lite_spec": {{
        "mark": "<appropriate chart type>",
        "encoding": {{
            /* your encodings using fields from the table */
        }}{{optional_transform_block}}
    }}
}}

Requirements for `vega_lite_spec`:
- No Markdown fences, no surrounding text. Only the JSON object.
- `vega_lite_spec` must be a valid Vega-Lite v5 dictionary.  
- Include `mark` and suitable `encoding` entries.
- Add a `transform` array if filtering or type conversion is needed.  
- Do not include a `data` key; the system will inject data later.
- All field names used in the spec must match the table headers exactly.

This chart will be shown to a multimodal model as visual grounding. Your spec should make the answer more complete by visually highlighting patterns that are difficult to capture in text alone.
